<h1 class="mix">trace my skin</h1>
<p>trace my skin with your gentle touch.</p>
<p>hieroglyphs sink into my back: symbols of what was meant to be, and what could've been. </p>
<p>even though I hate it when you stare at the things that only you can see, that same expression stole my heart. </p>
  <br>
<p>my body sinks, my body melts: into the darkness I go, racing into the night sky </p>
<p> disappearing without a trace, hoping that I can find you there.</p>
<p> I reach out a grab your hand, relaxing as we swim through the breeze. </p>
<p> tears stream down my face as your grip tightens around me. </p>
  <br>
<p>we'll never be alone this way, for mundane happiness follows us when we're together(regardless of where we are.)</p>
  <br>
<p> let me heal you of your lonely gaze, let me be something that only you can see. </p>
<p> we have already disappeared together, moving as one: let us create our own reality.</p>
  <br>
<p>trace my skin with your gentle touch.</p>
<p>your words sink into my skin, creating a vast expanse of infinite words and wordless confessions.</p>
